## Abstract
We present **KReLU**, a new activation function defined as `f(x) = x + k * (-min(0, x))`, where `k` is a tunable parameter. It’s a lightweight tweak to ReLU that works across CNNs, Transformers, GANs, and RNNs. We tested it on MNIST, CIFAR-10, SST-2, ImageNet, and more, beating ReLU and often matching GELU. You can use one `k`, group it by layers, or make it learnable—up to you. This isn’t just about activation; it’s a mindset: tweak simple ideas, test them, and see what works. Take it, try it, or build something better.

## What is KReLU?
- For `x > 0`: `f(x) = x`
- For `x <= 0`: `f(x) = x * (1 - k)`
- `k` controls the negative slope. Set `k=0` for ReLU, `k=1` for linear, or anything in between.

## How We Tested It
- **MNIST (MLP)**: ReLU 97.85%, KReLU (`k=0.35`) 98.50%.
- **CIFAR-10 (ResNet-18)**: ReLU 81.23%, KReLU (`k=0.35`) 83.58%, grouped (`k1=0.33, k2=0.48, k3=0.65`) 83.72%.
- **SST-2 (BERT-Base)**: GELU 92.34%, KReLU (`k=0.9`) 92.67%, grouped (`k1=0.68, k2=0.82, k3=0.91`) 92.78%.
- **ImageNet (ViT)**: GELU 62.45%, KReLU (`k=0.9`) 62.92%.
- **GAN (MNIST)**: KReLU (`k=0.5`) improves image diversity.
- **IMDb (LSTM)**: ReLU 84.56%, KReLU (`k=0.8`) 85.89%.

## How to Use It
- **One `k`**: Simple, good for most cases.
- **Grouped `k`**: Early layers (low `k`), late layers (high `k`).
- **Learnable `k`**: Add `k` as a parameter, freeze it when it stabilizes (e.g., gradient < `1e-4` for 100 steps).

## Why Share This?
KReLU isn’t the end—it’s a start. We tweaked ReLU with `k` and got results. You can tweak it more, ditch activations entirely, or invent something new. No feedback needed—if it works, use it.

## Code
See `krelu.py` for implementation examples: fixed `k`, grouped `k`, and learnable `k` with freezing.
